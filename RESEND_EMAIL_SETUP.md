# Resend Email Setup (No DNS Required!)

This document explains how to set up email notifications using **Resend** - a modern email service that doesn't require DNS configuration on your domain.

## 🚀 Why Resend?

- ✅ **No DNS Configuration Required** - Works immediately
- ✅ **Free Tier Available** - 3,000 emails/month, 100 emails/day
- ✅ **Built for Developers** - Perfect for Next.js applications
- ✅ **Reliable Delivery** - High deliverability rates
- ✅ **Easy Setup** - Just need an API key

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Resend API Key

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Go to **API Keys** in your dashboard
4. Create a new API key (give it a name like "Customer Flows")
5. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

### 2. Add Environment Variables in Vercel

Go to your Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables and add:

```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL=sagertim02@gmail.com
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

The code automatically uses the new Resend service:
- Uses endpoint: `/api/send-email-resend`
- Sends from: `Customer Flows <onboarding@resend.dev>`
- No DNS setup needed!

## 🧪 Testing

```
