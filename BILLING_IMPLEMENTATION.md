# Billing Tab Implementation

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema Update

- Added `stripe_customer_id` column to payments table
- Created migration file: `add-stripe-customer-id-migration.sql`
- Updated database types to include the new field

### 2. Billing Tab UI

- Added "Billing" tab to the dashboard navigation
- Created comprehensive billing section with:
  - Payment Status display
  - Subscription Management
  - Billing Information breakdown
  - Customer Portal access

### 3. Stripe Customer Portal Integration

- Added `getCustomerDetails()` function to fetch customer info
- Added `createCustomerPortalSession()` function for portal access
- Created `/api/create-portal-session` endpoint
- Added "Manage Subscription" button for existing customers

### 4. Payment Status Logic

- Shows "No payment yet" for users without payment records
- Shows "No active subscription" for users without customer IDs
- Shows payment status (pending/completed/failed) with details
- Displays payment amount and date information

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### For New Users (No Payment)

- Billing tab shows "No payment yet" message
- Explains payment is required when approving a demo
- Shows pricing information (99 CHF/month)

### For Users with Payments but No Customer ID

- Shows payment status from payments table
- Indicates subscription will be activated after payment completion
- Displays billing breakdown

### For Users with Stripe Customer ID

- Shows "Active Subscription" status
- Provides "Manage Subscription" button
- Redirects to Stripe Customer Portal for:
  - Updating payment methods
  - Viewing billing history
  - Managing subscription
  - Downloading invoices

## ðŸ“‹ Manual Steps Required

### 1. Database Migration

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
ALTER TABLE payments ADD COLUMN stripe_customer_id text;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_payments_stripe_customer_id ON payments(stripe_customer_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_payments_user_id_status ON payments(user_id, status);
```

### 2. Stripe Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your `.env.local`:

```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
```

### 3. Webhook Updates

Update your Stripe webhook handler to save the `customer_id` when payments are completed:

```typescript
// In webhook handler, when payment succeeds:
const { error } = await supabase
  .from("payments")
  .update({
    status: "completed",
    stripe_customer_id: stripeCustomerId, // Add this field
  })
  .eq("id", paymentId);
```
