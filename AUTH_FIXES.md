# Authentication State Management Fixes

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. Race Condition in AuthContext

**Problem**: The `onAuthStateChange` callback had inconsistent typing and wasn't handling session persistence properly during page refresh.

**Fix**:

- Added proper error handling for session retrieval
- Fixed TypeScript typing for the auth state change callback
- Added cleanup flag to prevent state updates after unmount
- Added console logging for debugging auth state changes

### 2. Aggressive Redirects in Home Page

**Problem**: The root page was immediately redirecting based on auth state, which could interfere with proper session restoration.

**Fix**:

- Added a small delay (100ms) before redirecting to ensure auth state is stable
- Added `redirecting` state to prevent multiple redirects
- Better loading state management

### 3. Session Persistence Configuration

**Problem**: The Supabase client wasn't properly configured for session persistence across page refreshes.

**Fix**:

- Added explicit cookie handling for session persistence
- Configured auth options: `persistSession: true`, `autoRefreshToken: true`, `detectSessionInUrl: true`
- Implemented manual cookie management for better cross-domain support

### 4. Dashboard Auth State Handling

**Problem**: Dashboard page wasn't waiting for auth state to load before redirecting unauthenticated users.

**Fix**:

- Added proper auth loading state check before redirecting
- Renamed local `loading` state to avoid conflicts with auth `loading`
- Only redirect to signin when auth is definitely not loading

## Key Changes Made

### `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

- Improved session initialization with error handling
- Fixed auth state change callback typing
- Added cleanup and mounting checks
- Added debug logging

### `/src/lib/supabase.ts`

- Added comprehensive cookie handling for session persistence
- Configured auth options for better session management
- Improved client configuration for browser environment

### `/src/app/page.tsx`

- Added redirect delay to ensure stable auth state
- Added redirecting state management
- Better loading state handling

### `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

- Added auth loading state check before redirecting
- Renamed conflicting loading state variable
- Improved loading state logic

## Testing Instructions

1. **Manual Refresh Test**:

   - Sign in to the dashboard
   - Manually refresh the page (Cmd+R)
   - Verify you remain logged in and aren't redirected to signup

2. **Session Persistence Test**:

   - Sign in to the dashboard
   - Close the browser tab
   - Open a new tab and navigate to the site
   - Verify you're still logged in

3. **Auth State Debugging**:
   - Open browser console
   - Look for "Auth state change:" logs to track authentication events
   - Verify proper session handling

## Additional Improvements

- Added refresh buttons to Dashboard tabs (Project Tracker & Demo Reviews)
- Improved error handling throughout auth flow
- Better TypeScript typing for auth callbacks
- Enhanced loading states across the application

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in your `.env.local` and Vercel dashboard:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`

## Deployment Notes

When deploying to Vercel:

1. Ensure environment variables are correctly set
2. Update Supabase Auth URL configuration to match production domain
3. Test session persistence in production environment
4. Monitor auth state logs in browser console for any issues
