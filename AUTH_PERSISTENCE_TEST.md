## Authentication Persistence Test

To test if the authentication persistence is working correctly after implementing the modern Supabase SSR setup:

### Manual Test Steps:

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Sign in to the application:**

   - Go to `/signin`
   - Sign in with valid credentials
   - Verify you're redirected to the dashboard

3. **Test page refresh persistence:**

   - While logged in and on the dashboard, refresh the page (Cmd+R or F5)
   - **EXPECTED**: You should remain logged in and see the dashboard content immediately
   - **BEFORE FIX**: You would see a loading spinner and potentially get logged out

4. **Test navigation persistence:**

   - Navigate to different pages in the app
   - Return to the dashboard
   - **EXPECTED**: No authentication issues or unexpected loading states

5. **Test browser tab persistence:**
   - Open a new tab and navigate to the dashboard URL directly
   - **EXPECTED**: You should be automatically authenticated if still logged in

### Technical Changes Made:

✅ **Replaced deprecated auth-helpers with @supabase/ssr**

- Created separate client/server Supabase clients
- Added proper middleware for session refresh

✅ **Improved AuthContext:**

- Removed problematic dependencies from useEffect
- Better error handling without automatic sign-out
- More stable client instance

✅ **Added middleware for automatic session refresh:**

- Automatically refreshes expired tokens
- Handles authentication state across page loads
- Redirects unauthenticated users appropriately

✅ **Updated all imports:**

- Client components use `@/utils/supabase/client`
- Server components/API routes use `@/utils/supabase/server`

### Key Benefits:

- **Persistent login across page refreshes**
- **Better session management**
- **Reduced infinite loading issues**
- **Improved user experience**
- **Modern, supported authentication flow**

The implementation follows the latest Supabase recommendations for Next.js authentication with server-side rendering.
