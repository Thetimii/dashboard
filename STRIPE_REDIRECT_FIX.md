# Fix Stripe Redirect and Authentication Issue

## Problem

When users complete payment on Stripe and get redirected to `/followup-questionnaire`, they're being logged out because the external redirect triggers an `INITIAL_SESSION` auth event that clears the user state.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed AuthContext (✅ DONE)

- Updated `AuthContext.tsx` to handle `INITIAL_SESSION` events more gracefully
- Now only clears user state on explicit `SIGNED_OUT` events
- Added better session persistence across external redirects

### 2. Updated Dashboard Payment Flow (✅ DONE)

- Modified dashboard to detect payment success from URL parameters
- Added automatic redirect to follow-up questionnaire after payment success
- Includes 2-second delay to ensure proper session restoration

### 3. Required Stripe Configuration Change

**You need to update your Stripe Payment Link success URL:**

**Current (problematic):**

```
https://yourdomain.com/followup-questionnaire
```

**New (fixed):**

```
https://yourdomain.com/dashboard?payment_success=true
```

**How to change this:**

1. Go to your Stripe Dashboard
2. Navigate to Payment Links
3. Find your payment link
4. Update the success URL to: `https://yourdomain.com/dashboard?payment_success=true`

### 4. How It Works Now

1. User approves demo and gets redirected to Stripe payment
2. User completes payment on Stripe
3. Stripe redirects to: `/dashboard?payment_success=true`
4. Dashboard detects payment success parameter
5. Dashboard waits 2 seconds for session to restore
6. Dashboard automatically redirects to `/followup-questionnaire`
7. User stays logged in throughout the entire flow

### 5. Alternative Parameters Supported

The dashboard also supports these success indicators:

- `?payment_success=true`
- `?session_id=cs_xxxxx` (Stripe session ID)

Both will trigger the automatic redirect to the follow-up questionnaire.

## Testing

1. Complete a demo approval and payment
2. Verify you stay logged in after Stripe redirect
3. Verify automatic redirect to follow-up questionnaire
4. Check that URL parameters are cleaned up after redirect

## Benefits

- ✅ Users stay logged in after payment
- ✅ Smooth redirect flow
- ✅ No more authentication issues
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ URL parameters are cleaned up automatically
